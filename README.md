# Peplum -- Distributed computing made easy

Peplum is a distributed parallel processing solution powered by [Cuboid](https://github.com/qadron/cuboid).

Its basic function is to distribute workloads and deliver payloads across multiple machines and thus parallelize 
otherwise time consuming tasks.

Basically, Peplum allows you to combine the resources of several machines and build a Beowulf (or otherwise) cluster/super-computer.

Being written in Ruby, you can deliver the payload of OS applications, Ruby code, C/C++/Rust extensions and package your Peplum app as a gem.

## Goal

The goal of the project is for Peplum to be to distributed computing development what Sinatra or Rails is for web application development.

An abstract, application-centric, straightforward and simple framework that get's out of your way and let's you accomplish your goals.

## Creating a Peplum application
