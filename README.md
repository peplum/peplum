# Peplum -- Distributed parallel computing made easy

Peplum is a distributed parallel processing solution powered by [Cuboid](https://github.com/qadron/cuboid) -- copyright
[Ecsypno Single Member P.C.](https://ecsypno.com).

Its basic function is to distribute workloads and deliver abstract payloads across multiple machines and thus parallelize 
otherwise time consuming tasks.

Basically, Peplum allows you to combine the resources of several machines and build a Beowulf (or otherwise) cluster/super-computer.

Being written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), you can deliver the payload of OS applications, Ruby code, C/C++/Rust 
extensions and package your Peplum app as a [gem](https://guides.rubygems.org/what-is-a-gem/).

## Goal

The goal of the project is for Peplum to be to distributed parallel computing development, what Sinatra or Rails is for
web application development.

An abstract, application-centric, straightforward and simple framework that get's out of your way and let's you accomplish your goals.

Basically, the project's essential goal is to allow users to turn applications and code into _super_ version of themselves with ease.

## Creating a Peplum application
